# dragonfly(eye) cascading style system

influenced by tachyons-verbose and various bespoke css. this is meant to be for
humans to write code but it's probably good for the machines too, idk. i do not
care at all about legacy browser support, if it's new and over 90%, i'm using
it.

## build

pending

## how to customize

`src/dragonfly.css` is the entry point, configure things here.

## debugging classes

there are two debugging classes, `.pesticide` and `pesticide-depth` you can add
to your html element to give you different colors per element. if you're early
on in dev or debugging a weird layout issue, it can be helpful.
