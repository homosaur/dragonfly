/* 
freaking lists man, i hate this. i hate that i have to write this code. this is
a very opinionated way to handle lists but the typographical way to handle lists
is quite straightforward.

the newer browser defaults are ok but i really tried to roll with them and i
kept cringing at how typographically ugly they are. these are not amazing, lists
in general need improvements in css capability, but they're definitely better
and they at least use your font's bullets.

feels like a waste to have all this code to make bullets 20% better, maybe, but
i did test them just to make sure they weren't more difficult to handle than the
defaults.

ordered list setup is a little better than default and provides a nice pattern
for you to start with. you may want need to customize them further, especially
if you're using lists with hundreds of items.
