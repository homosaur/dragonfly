            you've reached the office of dragonfly, a cascading style system
            meant for writers of html. dragonfly is not intended to be a
            replacement for big css frameworks like bootstrap or god forbid,
            tailwind, but an update to the abandoned css framework
            <a href="https://tachyons.io">tachyons</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            tachyons had a lot of good ideas but felt like it couldn't help
            itself from becoming a framework, and for no small reason this is
            why version 5 failed. dragonfly will only include styling for the
            basic html elements and may include some basic patterns that you can
            build components from, but will not include any pre-built
            components. it's meant, again, for writers of html.
        </p>
        <p>
            the original inspiration for dragonfly was writing static sites for
            indieweb projects using the static site generator
            <a href="https://11ty.dev">eleventy (11ty)</a>. 11ty is an amazing
            tool that provides a way to extend simple development techniques
            into larger scale projects. i found myself falling in love with the
            simplicity of regular html and mostly grumpy about writing css.
        </p>
        <p>
            dragonfly is named for the
            <a href="https://www.dragonfly-eye.online/">dragonfly-eye</a>, an
            image library project brought to you by the folks who run
            <a href="https://boot-boyz.biz">boot boyz</a> t-shirt project and
            the <a href="https://now-time.biz">now time</a> journal. it uses
            extensive code from the
            <a href="https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons-verbose/">tachyons-verbose</a>
            project.
        </p>
        <h2 class="f6 mt4 lhh">writers should not be using css frameworks</h2>
        <p>
            it feels like the absolute antethesis of the
            <a href="https://indieweb.org/principles">indieweb principles</a> to
            take your beautiful handcrafted html and slap a cold corporate css
            framework on it, making your site look and feel like a million
            others on the web. with the advent of ai programming, this is just
            going to get worse. so much dogcrap react code is coming for users,
            and the writers of the indieweb have a chance to fight against that.
            dragonfly says meta can pound salt and forget 10 layers of
            typescript tooling that you don't need for a blog, cv, or a thousand
            other personal applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            this is not a screed against css. i love css. i think it's an
            amazing technology, but so much has changed since the advent of big
            frameworks. i think that probably a lot of the popularity of css
            frameworks came from the difficulty of writing layout responsively.
            since then, we've gained tools like css grid and flexbox that can
            make layouts really elementary to write. this is the reason why
            while dragonfly contains classes for flexbox and grid, it includes
            few layout classes. write a layout using grid-templates and do all
            your responsive layout there. you don't need a hand to hold to do
            this. if you do, there's
            <a href="https://grid.layoutit.com/">tools</a> than can help you.
        </p>
        <p>
            most people making personal and indie projects do not need a css
            framework per se; they need a system for getting more from html.
            dragonfly is that system. please collaborate with me on this
            project if you find it of interest. despite seeming very
            opinionated, i'm actually amenable to suggestions and feedback. the
            best way is to simply send a path or open up an issue on the
            <a href="https://sr.ht/~homosaur/dragonfly/">sourcehut repo</a>.

        <h3 class="f5 mt3">todos</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>add media (images, videos, audio, figures, etc.)</li>
            <li>add inline forms and lists</li>
            <li>add label-type span</li>
            <li>add blockquote</li>
            <li>code blocks (swappable highlighting -- prism?)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="f6 mt4 lhh">how to use</h2>
        <p>
            you can either use dragonfly out of the box by compiling the css
            using `npm run build` or you can edit the files in `src/`. one of
            the easiest ways to slap your own theme on dragonfly is to edit the
            `_variables.css` file. i generated most of this file using the
            <a href="https://components.ai/theme/">components.ai</a> theme app,
            and you can do the same.
